# AssignmentTwo

Simple platformer, with controls A to move left, D to move right, S to stop and get a jump back, and W to jump.

I studied the physics library Box2d in order to make this project work. It proved to be very difficult, and I had a lot of things planned
that I couldn't make work. After this assignment, I'll hopefully continue on working this, as I started too late, and I feel like
this game has great potential.

The thing I'm most proud about is just learning to implement the BOX2D world as I found it a very difficult library to use.

There's a lot of code that's been commented out due to the fact that I couldn't make it work.
